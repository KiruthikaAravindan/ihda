## Caesar the Cat

Caesar is a companion cat who appears from Level 2 onward, curled on a floating platform in the middle of the level.

### Meeting Caesar (Levels 2–3)

Walk close to him and press **E** (or the 🐾 touch button) when the prompt appears. He wakes up, follows you briefly, and grants a **100 pt petting bonus**.

### Roaming mode (Levels 4–5)

Caesar is already bonded from the start and follows you across the level. Before Level 4 begins, a full-screen intro explains the treat system.

### Treats

Treats can be bought from the **🎒 Inventory** panel (available from Level 4, costs 5000 pts each). Press **F** or the 🐟 touch button to give Caesar a treat:

- He enters a **20-second frenzy**, chasing and catching nearby pigeons
- The treat button has a **20-second cooldown** after each use — a circular progress ring on the touch button (and a small arc in the desktop canvas HUD) shows time remaining

## Level-Save System

You have **3 lives per level**. Losing all lives shows the **LEVEL FAILED** screen:

| Situation | Retry cost | Score on retry |
|---|---|---|
| Level 1 fail | Free | Resets to 0 |
| Level 2+ fail, bank ≥ 2000 pts | 2000 pts | Bank minus 2000 |
| Level 2+ fail, bank < 2000 pts | N/A — button disabled | Use RESTART FROM L1 |

**"Bank"** = score accumulated before the current level started. Points earned during a failed level don't count — retrying always restores the cleaner pre-level baseline.

The **RESTART FROM L1** secondary button is always available and resets the full game.

## HUD

## Running Locally

ES Modules require HTTP — open via a local server, not `file://`. Run from the repo root:

```bash
# Node
npx http-server -p 8000 -c-1

# Python (if installed)
python -m http.server 8000
```

Then open `http://localhost:8000/`.
